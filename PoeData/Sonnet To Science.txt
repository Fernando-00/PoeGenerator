Science! meet daughter of old Time thou art
Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes!
Why prey’st thou thus upon the poet’s heart,
Vulture! whose wings are dull realities!
How should he love thee — or how deem thee wise
Who woulds’t not leave him, in his wandering,
To seek for treasure in the jewell’d skies
Albeit, he soar with an undaunted wing?
Hast thou not dragg’d Diana from her car,
And driv’n the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star?
The gentle Naiad from her fountain-flood?
The elfin from the green grass? and from me
The summer dream beneath the shrubbery?
