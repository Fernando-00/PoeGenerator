In visions of the dark night
I have dream’d of joy departed —
But a waking dream of life and light
Hath left me broken hearted:

And what is not a dream by day
To him whose eyes are cast
On things around him with a ray
Turn’d back upon the past?

That holy dream — that holy dream,
While all the world were chiding,
Hath cheer’d me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding: 

What tho’ that light, thro’ storm and night
So trembled from afar —
What could there be more purely bright
In Truth’s day-star? —
