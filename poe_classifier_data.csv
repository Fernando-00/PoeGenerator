"high on a mountain of enamell’d head — such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed of giant pasturage lying at his ease, raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees with many a mutter’d “hope to be forgiven” what time the moon is quadrated in heaven — of rosy head that, towering far away into the sunlit ether, caught the ray of sunken suns at eve — at noon of night, while the moon danc’d with the fair stranger light — uprear’d upon such height arose a pile of gorgeous columns on th’ unburthen’d air, flashing from parian marble that twin smile far down upon the wave that sparkled there, and nursled the young mountain in its lair: of molten stars their pavement, such as fall thro’ the ebon air, besilvering the pall of their own dissolution, while they die — adorning then the dwellings of the sky: a dome, by linked light from heaven let down, sat gently on these columns as a crown — a window of one circular diamond, there, look’d out above into the purple air, and rays from god shot down that meteor chain and hallow’d all the beauty twice again, save when, between th’ empyrean and that ring, some eager spirit flapp’d his dusky wing: but on the pillars seraph eyes have seen the dimness of this world: that greyish green that nature loves the best for beauty’s grave lurk’d in each cornice, round each architrave — and ev’ry sculptur’d cherub thereabout that, from his marble dwelling ventur’d out seem’d earthly in the shallow of his niche — archaian statues in a world so rich?

but what is this? — it cometh — and it brings a music with it — ’tis the rush of wings — a pause — and then a sweeping, falling strain and nesace is in her halls again: from the wild energy of wanton haste her cheek was flushing, and her lips apart; and zone that clung around her gentle waist had burst beneath the heaving of her heart: within the centre of that hall to breathe she paus’d and panted, zanthe! all beneath — the fairy light that kiss’d her golden hair and long’d to rest, yet could but sparkle there! young flowers were whispering in melody to happy flowers that night — and tree to tree; fountains were gushing music as they fell in many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell; yet silence came upon material things — fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings — and sound alone that from the spirit sprang bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang. “ ’neath blue-bell or streamer — or tufted wild spray that keeps, from the dreamer, the moonbeam away — bright beings! that ponder, with half closing eyes, on the stars which your wonder hath drawn from the skies, till they glance thro’ the shade, and come down to your brow like —— eyes of the maiden who calls on you now — arise! from your dreaming in violet bowers, to duty beseeming these star-litten hours — and shake from your tresses encumber’d with dew the breath of those kisses that cumber them too — [o! how, without you, love! could angels be blest]?

sweet was their death — with them to die was rife with the last extacy of satiate life — beyond that death no immortality — but sleep that pondereth and is not “to be” — and there — oh! may my weary spirit dwell — apart from heaven’s eternity — and yet how far from hell! what guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim, heard not the stirring summons of that hymn? but two: they fell: for heaven no grace imparts to those who hear not for their beating hearts. a maiden-angel and her seraph-lover — o! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over) was love, the blind, near sober duty known? unguided love hath fallen — ‘mid “tears of perfect moan:” he was a goodly spirit — he who fell: a wanderer by mossy mantled well — a gazer on the lights that shine above — a dreamer in the moonbeam by his love: what wonder? for each star is eye-like there, and looks so sweetly down on beauty’s hair — and they, and ev’ry mossy spring were holy to his love haunted heart and melancholy. the night had found (to him a night of wo) upon a mountain crag, young angelo — beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky, and scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie. here sate he with his love — his dark eye bent with eagle gaze along the firmament: now turn’d it upon her — but ever then it trembled to one constant star again. “ianthe, dearest, see! how dim that ray! how lovely ’tis to look so far away! she seem’d not thus upon that autumn eve i left her gorgeous halls — nor mourn’d to leave: that eve — that eve — i should remember well — the sun-ray dropp’d, in lemnos, with a spell on th’ ‘arabesq’ carving of a gilded hall wherein i sate, and on the drapried wall — and on my eye lids — o! the heavy light! how drowsily it weigh’d them into night! on flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran with persian saadi in his gulistan: but o! that light! — i slumber’d — death, the while, stole o’er my senses in that lovely isle so softly that no single silken hair awoke that slept — or knew that it was there. the last spot of earth’s orb i trod upon was a proud temple call’d the parthenon — more beauty clung around her column’d wall than ev’n thy glowing bosom beats withal, and when old time my wing did disenthral thence sprang i — as the eagle from his tower, and years i left behind me in an hour. what time upon her airy bounds i hung one half the garden of her globe was flung unrolling as a chart unto my view — tenantless cities of the desert too! ianthe, beauty crowded on me then, and half i wish’d to be again of men. “my angelo! and why of them to be? a brighter dwelling-place is here for thee — and greener fields than in yon world above, and women’s loveliness — and passionate love. “but, list, ianthe! when the air so soft fail’d, as my pennon’d spirit leapt aloft, perhaps my brain grew dizzy — but the world i left so late was into chaos hurl’d — sprang from her station, on the winds apart, and roll’d, a flame, the fiery heaven athwart. methought, my sweet one, then i ceas’d to soar and fell — not swiftly as i rose before, but with a downward, tremulous motion thro’ light, brazen rays, this golden star unto! nor long the measure of my falling hours, for nearest of all stars was thine to ours — dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth, a red dædalion on the timid earth! “we came — and to thy earth — but not to us be given our lady’s bidding to discuss: we came, my love; around, above, below, gay fire-fly of the night we come and go, nor ask a reason save the angel-nod she grants to us, as granted by her god — but, angelo, than thine grey time unfurl’d never his fairy wing o’er fairier world! dim was its little disk, and angel eyes alone could see the phantom in the skies, when first al aaraaf knew her course to be headlong thitherward o’er the starry sea — but when its glory swell’d upon the sky, as glowing beauty’s bust beneath man’s eye, we paus’d before the heritage of men, and thy star trembled — as doth beauty then!” thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away the night that waned and waned and brought no day they fell: for heaven to them no hope imparts who hear not for the beating of their hearts.",1
"from childhood’s hour i have not been as others were — i have not seen as others saw — i could not bring my passions from a common spring — from the same source i have not taken my sorrow — i could not awaken my heart to joy at the same tone — and all i lov’d — i lov’d alone — then — in my childhood — in the dawn of a most stormy life — was drawn from ev’ry depth of good and ill the mystery which binds me still — from the torrent, or the fountain — from the red cliff of the mountain — from the sun that ’round me roll’d in its autumn tint of gold — from the lightning in the sky as it pass’d me flying by — from the thunder, and the storm — and the cloud that took the form (when the rest of heaven was blue) of a demon in my view —",1

"oh! that my young life were a lasting dream! my spirit not awak’ning, till the beam of an eternity should bring the morrow. yes! tho’ that long dream were of hopeless sorrow. ’twere better than the cold reality of waking life, to him whose heart must be, and hath been still, upon the lovely earth, a chaos of deep passion, from his birth. but should it be — that dream eternally continuing — as dreams have been to me in my young boyhood — should it thus be giv’n ’twere folly still to hope for higher heav’n. for i have revell’d when the sun was bright in the summer sky, in dreams of living light. and loveliness, — have left my very heart in climes of my imaginings apart from mine own home, with beings that have been of mine own thought — what more could i have seen? ’twas once — and only once — and the wild hour from my remembrance shall not pass — some pow’r or spell had bound me — ’twas the chilly wind came o’er me in the night, and left behind its image on my spirit — or the moon shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon too coldly — or the stars — howe’er it was that dream was as that night-wind — let it pass. i have been happy, tho’ in a dream. i have been happy — and i love the theme: dreams! in their vivid colouring of life as in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife of semblance with reality which brings to the delirious eye, more lovely things of paradise and love — and all our own! than young hope in his sunniest hour hath known.",1
"take this kiss upon thy brow! and, in parting from you now, thus much let me avow — you are not wrong, who deem that my days have been a dream; yet if hope has flown away in a night, or in a day, in a vision, or in none, is it therefore the less gone? all that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream. i stand amid the roar of a surf-tormented shore, and i hold within my hand grains of the golden sand — how few! yet how they creep through my fingers to the deep, while i weep — while i weep! o, god! can i not grasp them with a tighter clasp? o, god! can i not save one from the pitiless wave? is all that we see or seem but a dream within a dream?",1
"gaily bedight, a gallant knight, in sunshine and in shadow, had journeyed long, singing a song, in search of eldorado. but he grew old — this knight so bold — and o’er his heart a shadow fell, as he found no spot of ground that looked like eldorado. and, as his strength failed him at length, he met a pilgrim shadow — “shadow,” said he, “where can it be — this land of eldorado?” “over the mountains of the moon, down the valley of the shadow, ride, boldly ride,” the shade replied, — “if you seek for eldorado!”",1
"elizabeth — it surely is most fit (logic and common usage so commanding) in thy own book that first thy name be writ, zeno and other sages notwithstanding: and i have other reasons for so doing besides my innate love of contradiction: each poet — if a poet — in pursuing the muses thro’ their bowers of truth or fiction, has studied very little of his part, read nothing, written less — in short’s a fool endued with neither soul, nor sense, nor art, being ignorant of one important rule, employed in even the theses of the school — called —— i forget the heathenish greek name — (called any thing, its meaning is the same) “always write first things uppermost in the heart”",1

"in the greenest of our valleys by good angels tenanted, once a fair and stately palace — snow-white palace — reared its head. in the monarch thought’s dominion — it stood there! never seraph spread his pinion over fabric half so fair. banners yellow, glorious, golden, on its roof did float and flow — this — all this — was in the olden time long ago — and every gentle air that dallied, in that sweet day, along the rampart plumed and pallid, a winged odour went away. all wanderers in that happy valley, through two luminous windows saw spirits moving musically to a lute’s well tuned law, round about a throne where sitting (porphyrogene!) in state his glory well befitting, the sovereign of the realm was seen. and all with pearl and ruby glowing was the fair palace door; through which came flowing, flowing, flowing, and sparkling evermore, a troop of echoes, whose sweet duty was but to sing in voices of surpassing beauty, the wit and wisdom of their king. but evil things in robes of sorrow, assailed the monarch’s high estate! ah, let us mourn — for never morrow shall dawn upon him desolate! and round about his home the glory, that blushed and bloomed, is but a dim-remembered story of the old time entombed. and travellers now within that valley, through the red-litten windows, see vast forms that move fantastically to a discordant melody; while, like a rapid ghastly river, through the pale door; a hideous throng rush out forever, and laugh — but smile no more.",1

"the thousand injuries of fortunato i had borne as i best could, but when he ventured upon insult i vowed revenge. you, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that i gave utterance to a threat. at length i would be avenged; this was a point definitively settled — but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. i must not only punish but punish with impunity. a wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. it is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. it must be understood that neither by word nor deed had i given fortunato cause to doubt my good will. i continued, as was my wont, to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my smile now was at the thought of his immolation. he had a weak point — this fortunato — although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. he prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine. few italians have the true virtuoso spirit. for the most part their enthusiasm is adopted to suit the time and opportunity, to practice imposture upon the british and austrian millionaires. in painting and gemmary, fortunato, like his countrymen, was a quack, but in the matter of old wines he was sincere. in this respect i did not differ from him materially; — i was skilful in the italian vintages myself, and bought largely whenever i could. it was about dusk, one evening during the supreme madness of the carnival season, that i encountered my friend. he accosted me with excessive warmth, for he had been drinking much. the man wore motley. he had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress, and his head was surmounted by the conical cap and bells. i was so pleased to see him that i thought i should never have done wringing his hand. i said to him — “my dear fortunato, you are luckily met. how remarkably well you are looking to-day! but i have received a pipe of what passes for amontillado, and i have my doubts.” “how?” said he. “amontillado? a pipe? impossible! and in the middle of the carnival!” “i have my doubts,” i replied; “and i was silly enough to pay the full amontillado price without consulting you in the matter. you were not to be found, and i was fearful of losing a bargain.” “amontillado!” “i have my doubts.” “amontillado!” “and i must satisfy them.” “amontillado!” “as you are engaged, i am on my way to luchesi. if any one has a critical turn it is he. he will tell me ——” “luchesi cannot tell amontillado from sherry.” “and yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for your own.” “come, let us go.” “whither?” “to your vaults.” “my friend, no; i will not impose upon your good nature. i perceive you have an engagement. luchesi ——” “i have no engagement; — come.” “my friend, no. it is not the engagement, but the severe cold with which i perceive you are afflicted. the vaults are insufferably damp. they are encrusted with nitre.” “let us go, nevertheless. the cold is merely nothing. amontillado! you have been imposed upon. and as for luchesi, he cannot distinguish sherry from amontillado.” thus speaking, fortunato possessed himself of my arm. putting on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about my person, i suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo. there were no attendants at home; they had absconded to make merry in honour of the time. i had told them that i should not return until the morning, and had given them explicit orders not to stir from the house. these orders were sufficient, i well knew, to insure their immediate disappearance, one and all, as soon as my back was turned. i took from their sconces two flambeaux, and giving one to fortunato, bowed him through several suites of rooms to the archway that led into the vaults. i passed down a long and winding staircase, requesting him to be cautious as he followed. we came at length to the foot of the descent, and stood together on the damp ground of the catacombs of the montresors. the gait of my friend was unsteady, and the bells upon his cap jingled as he strode. “the pipe,” said he. “it is farther on,” said i; “but observe the white web-work which gleams from these cavern walls.” he turned towards me, and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs that distilled the rheum of intoxication . “nitre?” he asked, at length. “nitre,” i replied. “how long have you had that cough?” “ugh! ugh! ugh! — ugh! ugh! ugh! — ugh! ugh! ugh! — ugh! ugh! ugh! — ugh! ugh! ugh!” my poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes. “it is nothing,” he said, at last. “come,” i said, with decision, “we will go back; your health is precious. you are rich, respected, admired, beloved; you are happy, as once i was. you are a man to be missed. for me it is no matter. we will go back; you will be ill, and i cannot be responsible. besides, there is luchesi ——” “enough,” he said; “the cough is a mere nothing; it will not kill me. i shall not die of a cough.” “true — true,” i replied; “and, indeed, i had no intention of alarming you unnecessarily — but you should use all proper caution. a draught of this medoc will defend us from the damps.” here i knocked off the neck of a bottle which i drew from a long row of its fellows that lay upon the mould. “drink,” i said, presenting him the wine. he raised it to his lips with a leer. he paused and nodded to me familiarly, while his bells jingled. “i drink,” he said, “to the buried that repose around us.” “and i to your long life.” he again took my arm, and we proceeded. “these vaults,” he said, “are extensive.” “the montresors,” i replied, “were a great and numerous family.” “i forget your arms.” “a huge human foot d‘or, in a field azure; the foot crushes a serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in the heel.” “and the motto?” “nemo me impune lacessit.” “good!” he said. the wine sparkled in his eyes and the bells jingled. my own fancy grew warm with the medoc. we had passed through walls of piled bones, with casks and puncheons intermingling, into the inmost recesses of the catacombs. i paused again, and this time i made bold to seize fortunato by an arm above the elbow. “the nitre!” i said: “see, it increases. it hangs like moss upon the vaults. we are below the river‘s bed. the drops of moisture trickle among the bones. come, we will go back ere it is too late. your cough ——” “it is nothing,” he said; “let us go on. but first, another draught of the medoc.” i broke and reached him a flaçon of de grâve. he emptied it at a breath. his eyes flashed with a fierce light. he laughed and threw the bottle upwards with a gesticulation i did not understand. i looked at him in surprise. he repeated the movement — a grotesque one. “you do not comprehend?” he said. “not i,” i replied. “then you are not of the brotherhood.” “how?” “you are not of the masons.” “yes, yes,” i said; “yes, yes.” “you? impossible! a mason?” “a mason,” i replied. “a sign,” he said. “it is this,” i answered, producing a trowel from beneath the folds of my roquelaire. “you jest,” he exclaimed, recoiling a few paces. “but let us proceed to the amontillado.” “be it so,” i said, replacing the tool beneath the cloak and again offering him my arm. he leaned upon it heavily. we continued our route in search of the amontillado. we passed through a range of low arches, descended, passed on, and descending again, arrived at a deep crypt, in which the foulness of the air caused our flambeaux rather to glow than flame. at the most remote end of the crypt there appeared another less spacious. its walls had been lined with human remains, piled to the vault overhead, in the fashion of the great catacombs of paris. three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this manner. from the fourth the bones had been thrown down, and lay promiscuously upon the earth, forming at one point a mound of some size. within the wall thus exposed by the displacing of the bones, we perceived a still interior recess, in depth about four feet, in width three, in height six or seven. it seemed to have been constructed for no especial use within itself, but formed merely the interval between two of the colossal supports of the roof of the catacombs, and was backed by one of their circumscribing walls of solid granite. it was in vain that fortunato, uplifting his dull torch, endeavoured to pry into the depths of the recess. its termination the feeble light did not enable us to see. “proceed,” i said; “herein is the amontillado. as for luchesi ——” “he is an ignoramus,” interrupted my friend, as he stepped unsteadily forward, while i followed immediately at his heels. in an instant he had reached the extremity of the niche, and finding his progress arrested by the rock, stood stupidly bewildered. a moment more and i had fettered him to the granite. in its surface were two iron staples, distant from each other about two feet, horizontally. from one of these depended a short chain, from the other a padlock. throwing the links about his waist, it was but the work of a few seconds to secure it. he was too much astounded to resist. withdrawing the key i stepped back from the recess. “pass your hand,” i said, “over the wall; you cannot help feeling the nitre. indeed, it is very damp. once more let me implore you to return. no? then i will positively leave you. but i must first render you all the little attentions in my power.” “the amontillado!” ejaculated my friend, not yet recovered from his astonishment. “true,” i replied; “the amontillado.” as i said these words i busied myself among the pile of bones of which i have before spoken. throwing them aside, i soon uncovered a quantity of building stone and mortar. with these materials and with the aid of my trowel, i began vigorously to wall up the entrance of the niche. i had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when i discovered that the intoxication of fortunato had in a great measure worn off. the earliest indication i had of this was a low moaning cry from the depth of the recess. it was not the cry of a drunken man. there was then a long and obstinate silence. i laid the second tier, and the third, and the fourth; and then i heard the furious vibrations of the chain. the noise lasted for several minutes, during which, that i might hearken to it with the more satisfaction, i ceased my labours and sat down upon the bones. when at last the clanking subsided, i resumed the trowel, and finished without interruption the fifth, the sixth, and the seventh tier. the wall was now nearly upon a level with my breast. i again paused, and holding the flambeaux over the mason-work, threw a few feeble rays upon the figure within. a succession of loud and shrill screams, bursting suddenly from the throat of the chained form, seemed to thrust me violently back. for a brief moment i hesitated, i trembled. unsheathing my rapier, i began to grope with it about the recess; but the thought of an instant reassured me. i placed my hand upon the solid fabric of the catacombs, and felt satisfied. i reapproached the wall. i replied to the yells of him who clamoured. i re-echoed — i aided — i surpassed them in volume and in strength. i did this, and the clamourer grew still. it was now midnight, and my task was drawing to a close. i had completed the eighth, the ninth, and the tenth tier. i had finished a portion of the last and the eleventh; there remained but a single stone to be fitted and plastered in. i struggled with its weight; i placed it partially in its destined position. but now there came from out the niche a low laugh that erected the hairs upon my head. it was succeeded by a sad voice, which i had difficulty in recognising as that of the noble fortunato. the voice said — “ha! ha! ha! — he! he! he! — a very good joke, indeed — an excellent jest. we will have many a rich laugh about it at the palazzo — he! he! he! — over our wine — he! he! he!” “the amontillado!” i said. “he! he! he! — he! he! he! — yes, the amontillado. but is it not getting late? will not they be awaiting us at the palazzo — the lady fortunato and the rest? let us be gone.” “yes,” i said, “let us be gone.” “for the love of god, montresor!” “yes,” i said, “for the love of god!” but to these words i hearkened in vain for a reply. i grew impatient. i called aloud — “fortunato!” no answer. i called again — “fortunato!” no answer still. i thrust a torch through the remaining aperture and let it fall within. there came forth in return only a jingling of the bells. my heart grew sick — on account of the dampness of the catacombs. i hastened to make an end of my labour. i forced the last stone into its position; i plastered it up. against the new masonry i re-erected the old rampart of bones. for the half of a century no mortal has disturbed them. in pace requiescat!",1
"i am come of a race noted for vigor of fancy and ardor of passion. men have called me mad; but the question is not yet settled, whether madness is or is not the loftiest intelligence — whether much that is glorious — whether all that is profound — does not spring from disease of thought — from moods of mind exalted at the expense of the general intellect. they who dream by day are cognizant of many things which escape those who dream only by night. in their gray visions they obtain glimpses of eternity, and thrill, in awaking, to find that they have been upon the verge of the great secret. in snatches, they learn something of the wisdom which is of good, and more of the mere knowledge which is of evil. they penetrate, however, rudderless or compassless, into the vast ocean of the “light ineffable” and again, like the adventures of the nubian geographer, “agressi sunt mare tenebrarum, quid in eo esset exploraturi.” we will say, then, that i am mad. i grant, at least, that there are two distinct conditions of my mental existence — the condition of a lucid reason, not to be disputed, and belonging to the memory of events forming the first epoch of my life — and a condition of shadow and doubt, appertaining to the present, and to the recollection of what constitutes the second great era of my being. therefore, what i shall tell of the earlier period, believe; and to what i may relate of the later time, give only such credit as may seem due; or doubt it altogether; or, if doubt it ye cannot, then play unto its riddle the oedipus. she whom i loved in youth, and of whom i now pen calmly and distinctly these remembrances, was the sole daughter of the only sister of my mother long departed. eleonora was the name of my cousin. we had always dwelled together, beneath a tropical sun, in the valley of the many-colored grass. no unguided footstep ever came upon that vale; for it lay far away up among a range of giant hills that hung beetling around about it, shutting out the sunlight from its sweetest recesses. no path was trodden in its vicinity; and, to reach our happy home, there was need of putting back, with force, the foliage of many thousands of forest trees, and of crushing to death the glories of many millions of fragrant flowers. thus it was that we lived all alone, knowing nothing of the world without the valley, — i, and my cousin, and her mother. from the dim regions beyond the mountains at the upper end of our encircled domain, there crept out a narrow and deep river, brighter than all save the eyes of eleonora; and, winding stealthily about in mazy courses, it passed away, at length, through a shadowy gorge, among hills still dimmer than those whence it had issued. we called it the “river of silence:” for there seemed to be a hushing influence in its flow. no murmur arose from its bed, and so gently it wandered along, that the pearly pebbles upon which we loved to gaze, far down within its bosom, stirred not at all, but lay in a motionless content, each in its own old station, shining on gloriously forever. the margin of the river, and of the many dazzling rivulets that glided through devious ways into its channel, as well as the spaces that extended from the margins away down into the depths of the streams until they reached the bed of pebbles at the bottom, — these spots, not less than the whole surface of the valley, from the river to the mountains that girdled it in, were carpeted all by a soft green grass, thick, short, perfectly even, and vanilla-perfumed, but so besprinkled throughout with the yellow buttercup, the white daisy, the purple violet, and the ruby-red asphodel, that its exceeding beauty spoke to our hearts in loud tones, of the love and of the glory of god. and, here and there, in groves about this grass, like wildernesses of dreams, sprang up fantastic trees, whose tall slender stems stood not upright, but slanted gracefully towards the light that peered at noon-day into the centre of the valley. their bark was speckled with the vivid alternate splendor of ebony and silver, and was smoother than all save the cheeks of eleonora; so that but for the brilliant green of the huge leaves that spread from their summits in long, tremulous lines, dallying with the zephyrs, one might have fancied them giant serpents of syria doing homage to their sovereign the sun. hand in hand about this valley, for fifteen years, roamed i with eleonora before love entered within our hearts. it was one evening at the close of the third lustrum of her life, and of the fourth of my own, that we sat, locked in each other’s embrace, beneath the serpent-like trees, and looked down within the waters of the river of silence at our images therein. we spoke no words during the rest of that sweet day; and our words even upon the morrow were tremulous and few. we had drawn the god eros from that wave, and now we felt that he had enkindled within us the fiery souls of our forefathers. the passions which had for centuries distinguished our race, came thronging with the fancies for which they had been equally noted, and together breathed a delirious bliss over the valley of the many-colored grass. a change fell upon all things. strange, brilliant flowers, star-shaped, burst out upon the trees where no flowers had been known before. the tints of the green carpet deepened; and when, one by one, the white daisies shrank away, there sprang up in place of them, ten by ten of the ruby-red asphodel. and life arose in our paths; for the tall flamingo, hitherto unseen, with all gay glowing birds, flaunted his scarlet plumage before us. the golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of æolus — sweeter than all save the voice of eleonora. and now, too, a voluminous cloud, which we had long watched in the regions of hesper, floated out thence, all gorgeous in crimson and gold, and settling in peace above us, sank, day by day, lower and lower, until its edges rested upon the tops of the mountains, turning all their dimness into magnificence, and shutting us up, as if forever, within a magic prison-house of grandeur and of glory. the loveliness of eleonora was that of the seraphim; but she was a maiden artless and innocent as the brief life she had led among the flowers. no guile disguised the fervor of love which animated her heart, and she examined with me its inmost recesses as we walked together in the valley of the many-colored grass, and discoursed of the mighty changes which had lately taken place therein. at length, having spoken one day, in tears, of the last sad change which must befall humanity, she thenceforward dwelt only upon this one sorrowful theme, interweaving it into all our converse, as, in the songs of the bard of schiraz, the same images are found occurring, again and again, in every impressive variation of phrase. she had seen that the finger of death was upon her bosom — that, like the ephemeron, she had been made perfect in loveliness only to die; but the terrors of the grave to her, lay solely in a consideration which she revealed to me, one evening at twilight, by the banks of the river of silence. she grieved to think that, having entombed her in the valley of the many-colored grass, i would quit forever its happy recesses, transferring the love which now was so passionately her own to some maiden of the outer and every-day world. and, then and there, i threw myself hurriedly at the feet of eleonora, and offered up a vow, to herself and to heaven, that i would never bind myself in marriage to any daughter of earth — that i would in no manner prove recreant to her dear memory, or to the memory of the devout affection with which she had blessed me. and i called the mighty ruler of the universe to witness the pious solemnity of my vow. and the curse which i invoked of him and of her, a saint in helusion, should i prove traitorous to that promise, involved a penalty the exceeding great horror of which will not permit me to make record of it here. and the bright eyes of eleonora grew brighter at my words; and she sighed as if a deadly burthen had been taken from her breast; and she trembled and very bitterly wept; but she made acceptance of the vow, (for what was she but a child?) and it made easy to her the bed of her death. and she said to me, not many days afterwards, tranquilly dying, that, because of what i had done for the comfort of her spirit she would watch over me in that spirit when departed, and, if so it were permitted her return to me visibly in the watches of the night; but, if this thing were, indeed, beyond the power of the souls in paradise, that she would, at least, give me frequent indications of her presence; sighing upon me in the evening winds, or filling the air which i breathed with perfume from the censers of the angels. and, with these words upon her lips, she yielded up her innocent life, putting an end to the first epoch of my own. thus far i have faithfully said. but as i pass the barrier in time’s path, formed by the death of my beloved, and proceed with the second era of my existence, i feel that a shadow gathers over my brain, and i mistrust the perfect sanity of the record. but let me on. — years dragged themselves along heavily, and still i dwelled within the valley of the many-colored grass; but a second change had come upon all things. the star-shaped flowers shrank into the stems of the trees, and appeared no more. the tints of the green carpet faded; and, one by one, the ruby-red asphodels withered away; and there sprang up, in place of them, ten by ten, dark, eye-like violets, that writhed uneasily and were ever encumbered with dew. and life departed from our paths; for the tall flamingo flaunted no longer his scarlet plumage before us, but flew sadly from the vale into the hills, with all the gay glowing birds that had arrived in his company. and the golden and silver fish swam down through the gorge at the lower end of our domain and bedecked the sweet river never again. and the lulling melody that had been softer than the wind-harp of æolus, and more divine than all save the voice of eleonora, it died little by little away, in murmurs growing lower and lower, until the stream returned, at length, utterly, into the solemnity of its original silence. and then, lastly, the voluminous cloud uprose, and, abandoning the tops of the mountains to the dimness of old, fell back into the regions of hesper, and took away all its manifold golden and gorgeous glories from the valley of the many-colored grass. yet the promises of eleonora were not forgotten; for i heard the sounds of the swinging of the censers of the angels; and streams of a holy perfume floated ever and ever about the valley; and at lone hours, when my heart beat heavily, the winds that bathed my brow came unto me laden with soft sighs; and indistinct murmurs filled often the night air; and once — oh, but once only! i was awakened from a slumber, like the slumber of death, by the pressing of spiritual lips upon my own. but the void within my heart refused, even thus, to be filled. i longed for the love which had before filled it to overflowing. at length the valley pained me through its memories of eleonora, and i left it forever for the vanities and the turbulent triumphs of the world. i found myself within a strange city, where all things might have served to blot from recollection the sweet dreams i had dreamed so long in the valley of the many-colored grass. the pomps and pageantries of a stately court, and the mad clangor of arms, and the radiant loveliness of woman, bewildered and intoxicated my brain. but as yet my soul had proved true to its vows, and the indications of the presence of eleonora were still given me in the silent hours of the night. suddenly, these manifestations they ceased; and the world grew dark before mine eyes; and i stood aghast at the burning thoughts which possessed — at the terrible temptations which beset me; for there came from some far, far distant and unknown land, into the gay court of the king i served, a maiden to whose beauty my whole recreant heart yielded at once — at whose footstool i bowed down without a struggle, in the most ardent, in the most abject worship of love. what indeed was my passion for the young girl of the valley in comparison with the fervor, and the delirium, and the spirit-lifting ecstasy of adoration with which i poured out my whole soul in tears at the feet of the ethereal ermengarde? — oh, bright was the seraph ermengarde! and in that knowledge i had room for none other. — oh, divine was the angel ermengarde! and as i looked down into the depths of her memorial eyes, i thought only of them — and of her. i wedded; — nor dreaded the curse i had invoked; and its bitterness was not visited upon me. and once — but once again in the silence of the night, there came through my lattice the soft sighs which had forsaken me; and they modelled themselves into familiar and sweet voice, saying: “sleep in peace! — for the spirit of love reigneth and ruleth, and, in taking to thy passionate heart her who is ermengarde, thou art absolved, for reasons which shall be made known to thee in heaven, of thy vows unto eleonora.”",1
"true! — nervous — very, very dreadfully nervous i had been and am; but why will you say that i am mad? the disease had sharpened my senses — not destroyed — not dulled them. above all was the sense of hearing acute. i heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. i heard many things in hell. how, then, am i mad? hearken! and observe how healthily — how calmly i can tell you the whole story. it is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. object there was none. passion there was none. i loved the old man. he had never wronged me. he had never given me insult. for his gold i had no desire. i think it was his eye! yes, it was this! one of his eyes resembled that of a vulture — a pale blue eye, with a film over it. whenever it fell upon me, my blood ran cold; and so by degrees — very gradually — i made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever. now this is the point. you fancy me mad. madmen know nothing. but you should have seen me. you should have seen how wisely i proceeded — with what caution — with what foresight — with what dissimulation i went to work! i was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before i killed him. and every night, about midnight, i turned the latch of his door and opened it — oh, so gently! and then, when i had made an opening sufficient for my head, i put in a dark lantern, all closed, closed, so that no light shone out, and then i thrust in my head. oh, you would have laughed to see how cunningly i thrust it in! i moved it slowly — very, very slowly, so that i might not disturb the old man’s sleep. it took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that i could see him as he lay upon his bed. ha! — would a madman have been so wise as this? and then, when my head was well in the room, i undid the lantern cautiously — oh, so cautiously — cautiously (for the hinges creaked) — i undid it just so much that a single thin ray fell upon the vulture eye. and this i did for seven long nights — every night just at midnight — but i found the eye always closed; and so it was impossible to do the work; for it was not the old man who vexed me, but his evil eye. and every morning, when the day broke, i went boldly into the chamber, and spoke courageously to him, calling him by name in a hearty tone, and inquiring how he had passed the night. so you see he would have been a very profound old man, indeed, to suspect that every night, just at twelve, i looked in upon him while he slept. upon the eighth night i was more than usually cautious in opening the door. a watch’s minute hand moves more quickly than did mine. never before that night had i felt the extent of my own powers — of my sagacity. i could scarcely contain my feelings of triumph. to think that there i was, opening the door, little by little, and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts. i fairly chuckled at the idea; and perhaps he heard me; for he moved on the bed suddenly, as if startled. now you may think that i drew back — but no. his room was as black as pitch with the thick darkness, (for the shutters were close fastened, through fear of robbers,) and so i knew that he could not see the opening of the door, and i kept pushing it on steadily, steadily. i had my head in, and was about to open the lantern, when my thumb slipped upon the tin fastening, and the old man sprang up in the bed, crying out — “who’s there?” i kept quite still and said nothing. for a whole hour i did not move a muscle, and in the meantime i did not hear him lie down. he was still sitting up in the bed listening; — just as i have done, night after night, hearkening to the death watches in the wall. presently i heard a slight groan, and i knew it was the groan of mortal terror. it was not a groan of pain or of grief — oh, no! — it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged with awe. i knew the sound well. many a night, just at midnight, when all the world slept, it has welled up from my own bosom, deepening, with its dreadful echo, the terrors that distracted me. i say i knew it well. i knew what the old man felt, and pitied him, although i chuckled at heart. i knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise, when he had turned in the bed. his fears had been ever since growing upon him. he had been trying to fancy them causeless, but could not. he had been saying to himself — “it is nothing but the wind in the chimney — it is only a mouse crossing the floor,” or “it is merely a cricket which has made a single chirp.” yes, he has been trying to comfort himself with these suppositions: but he had found all in vain. all in vain; because death, in approaching him had stalked with his black shadow before him, and enveloped the victim. and it was the mournful influence of the unperceived shadow that caused him to feel — although he neither saw nor heard — to feel the presence of my head within the room. when i had waited a long time, very patiently, without hearing him lie down, i resolved to open a little — a very, very little crevice in the lantern. so i opened it — you cannot imagine how stealthily, stealthily — until, at length a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot from out the crevice and fell upon the vulture eye. it was open — wide, wide open — and i grew furious as i gazed upon it. i saw it with perfect distinctness — all a dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones; but i could see nothing else of the old man’s face or person: for i had directed the ray as if by instinct, precisely upon the damned spot. and now have i not told you that what you mistake for madness is but over acuteness of the senses? — now, i say, there came to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. i knew that sound well, too. it was the beating of the old man’s heart. it increased my fury, as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage. but even yet i refrained and kept still. i scarcely breathed. i held the lantern motionless. i tried how steadily i could maintain the ray upon the eye. meantime the hellish tattoo of the heart increased. it grew quicker and quicker, and louder and louder every instant. the old man’s terror must have been extreme! it grew louder, i say, louder every moment! — do you mark me well? i have told you that i am nervous: so i am. and now at the dead hour of the night, amid the dreadful silence of that old house, so strange a noise as this excited me to uncontrollable terror. yet, for some minutes longer i refrained and stood still. but the beating grew louder, louder! i thought the heart must burst. and now a new anxiety seized me — the sound would be heard by a neighbor! the old man’s hour had come! with a loud yell, i threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. he shrieked once — once only. in an instant i dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. i then smiled gaily, to find the deed so far done. but, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled sound. this, however, did not vex me; it would not be heard through the wall. at length it ceased. the old man was dead. i removed the bed and examined the corpse. yes, he was stone, stone dead. i placed my hand upon the heart and held it there many minutes. there was no pulsation. he was stone dead. his eye would trouble me no more. if still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when i describe the wise precautions i took for the concealment of the body. the night waned, and i worked hastily, but in silence. first of all i dismembered the corpse. i cut off the head and the arms and the legs. i then took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. i then replaced the boards so cleverly, so cunningly, that no human eye — not even his — could have detected any thing wrong. there was nothing to wash out — no stain of any kind — no blood-spot whatever. i had been too wary for that. a tub had caught all — ha! ha! when i had made an end of these labors, it was four o ‘clock — still dark as midnight. as the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. i went down to open it with a light heart, — for what had i now to fear? there entered three men, who introduced themselves, with perfect suavity, as officers of the police. a shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night; suspicion of foul play had been aroused; information had been lodged at the police office, and they (the officers) had been deputed to search the premises. i smiled, — for what had i to fear? i bade the gentlemen welcome. the shriek, i said, was my own in a dream. the old man, i mentioned, was absent in the country. i took my visitors all over the house. i bade them search — search well. i led them, at length, to his chamber. i showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. in the enthusiasm of my confidence, i brought chairs into the room, and desired them here to rest from their fatigues, while i myself, in the wild audacity of my perfect triumph, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse of the victim. the officers were satisfied. my manner had convinced them. i was singularly at ease. they sat, and while i answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things. but, ere long, i felt myself getting pale and wished them gone. my head ached, and i fancied a ringing in my ears: but still they sat and still chatted. the ringing became more distinct: — it continued and became more distinct: i talked more freely to get rid of the feeling: but it continued and gained definitiveness — until, at length, i found that the noise was not within my ears. no doubt i now grew very pale; — but i talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. yet the sound increased — and what could i do? it was a low, dull, quick sound — much such a sound as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. i gasped for breath — and yet the officers heard it not. i talked more quickly — more vehemently; but the noise steadily increased. i arose and argued about trifles, in a high key and with violent gesticulations; but the noise steadily increased. why would they not be gone? i paced the floor to and fro with heavy strides, as if excited to fury by the observations of the men — but the noise steadily increased. oh god! what could i do? i foamed — i raved — i swore! i swung the chair upon which i had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. it grew louder — louder — louder! and still the men chatted pleasantly, and smiled. was it possible they heard not? almighty god! — no, no! they heard! — they suspected! — they knew! — they were making a mockery of my horror! — this i thought, and this i think. but anything was better than this agony! anything was more tolerable than this derision! i could bear those hypocritical smiles no longer! i felt that i must scream or die! — and now — again! — hark! louder! louder! louder! louder! — “villains!” i shrieked, “dissemble no more! i admit the deed! — tear up the planks! — here, here! — it is the beating of his hideous heart!”",1
"i have sent for thee, holy friar; but ’twas not with the drunken hope, which is but agony of desire to shun the fate, with which to cope is more than crime may dare to dream, that i have call’d thee at this hour: such father is not my theme — nor am i mad, to deem that power of earth may shrive me of the sin unearthly pride hath revell’d in — i would not call thee fool, old man, but hope is not a gift of thine; if i can hope (o god! i can) it falls from an eternal shrine. ii. the gay wall of this gaudy tower grows dim around me — death is near. i had not thought, until this hour when passing from the earth, that ear of any, were it not the shade of one whom in life i made all mystery but a simple name, might know the secret of a spirit bow’d down in sorrow, and in shame. — shame said’st thou? aye i did inherit that hated portion, with the fame, the worldly glory, which has shown a demon-light around my throne, scorching my sear’d heart with a pain not hell shall make me fear again. iii. i have not always been as now — the fever’d diadem on my brow i claim’d and won usurpingly — aye — the same heritage hath giv’n rome to the cæsar — this to me; the heirdom of a kingly mind — and a proud spirit, which hath striv’n triumphantly with human kind. in mountain air i first drew life; the mists of the taglay have shed nightly their dews on my young head; and my brain drank their venom then, when after day of perilous strife with chamois, i would seize his den and slumber, in my pride of power, the infant monarch of the hour — for, with the mountain dew by night, my soul imbib’d unhallow’d feeling; and i would feel its essence stealing in dreams upon me — while the light flashing from cloud that hover’d o’er, would seem to my half closing eye the pageantry of monarchy! and the deep thunder’s echoing roar came hurriedly upon me, telling of war, and tumult, where my voice my own voice, silly child! was swelling (o how would my wild heart rejoice and leap within me at the cry) the battle-cry of victory! * * * * * iv. the rain came down upon my head but barely shelter’d — and the wind pass’d quickly o’er me — but my mind was mad’ning — for ’twas man that shed laurels upon me — and the rush, the torrent of the chilly air gurgled in my pleas’d ear the crush of empires, with the captive’s prayer, the hum of suitors, the mix’d tone of flatt’ry round a sov’reign’s throne. the storm had ceas’d — and i awoke — its spirit cradled me to sleep, and as it pass’d me by, there broke strange light upon me, tho’ it were my soul in mystery to steep: for i was not as i had been; the child of nature, without care, or thought, save of the passing scene. — v. my passions, from that hapless hour, usurp’d a tyranny, which men have deem’d, since i have reach’d to power my innate nature — be it so: but, father, there liv’d one who, then — then, in my boyhood, when their fire burn’d with a still intenser glow; (for passion must with youth expire) ev’n then, who deem’d this iron heart in woman’s weakness had a part. i have no words, alas! to tell the lovliness of loving well! nor would i dare attempt to trace the breathing beauty of a face, which ev’n to my impassion’d mind, leaves not its memory behind. in spring of life have ye ne’er dwelt some object of delight upon, with steadfast eye, till ye have felt the earth reel — and the vision gone? and i have held to mem’ry’s eye one object — and but one — until its very form hath pass’d me by, but left its influence with me still. vi. ’tis not to thee that i should name — thou can’st not — would’st not dare to think the magic empire of a flame which ev’n upon this perilous brink hath fix’d my soul, tho’ unforgiv’n by what it lost for passion — heav’n. i lov’d — and o, how tenderly! yes! she was worthy of all love! such as in infancy was mine tho’ then its passion could not be: ’twas such as angel minds above might envy — her young heart the shrine on which my ev’ry hope and thought were incense — then a goodly gift — for they were childish, without sin, pure as her young examples taught; why did i leave it and adrift, trust to the fickle star within? vii. we grew in age, and love together, roaming the forest and the wild; my breast her shield in wintry weather, and when the friendly sunshine smil’d and she would mark the op’ning skies, i saw no heav’n, but in her eyes — ev’n childhood knows the human heart; for when, in sunshine and in smiles, from all our little cares apart, laughing at her half silly wiles, i’d throw me on her throbbing breast, and pour my spirit out in tears, she’d look up in my wilder’d eye — there was no need to speak the rest — no need to quiet her kind fears — she did not ask the reason why. the hallow’d mem’ry of those years comes o’er me in these lonely hours, and, with sweet lovliness, appears as perfume of strange summer flow’rs; of flow’rs which we have known before in infancy, which seen, recall to mind — not flow’rs alone — but more our earthly life, and love — and all. viii. yes! she was worthy of all love! ev’n such as from th’ accursed time my spirit with the tempest strove, when on the mountain peak alone, ambition lent it a new tone, and bade it first to dream of crime, my frenzy to her bosom taught: we still were young: no purer thought dwelt in a seraph’s breast than thine; for passionate love is still divine: i lov’d her as an angel might with ray of the all living light which blazes upon edis’ shrine. it is not surely sin to name, with such as mine — that mystic flame, i had no being but in thee! the world with all its train of bright and happy beauty (for to me all was an undefin’d delight) the world — its joy — its share of pain which i felt not — its bodied forms of varied being, which contain the bodiless spirits of the storms, the sunshine, and the calm — the ideal and fleeting vanities of dreams, fearfully beautiful! the real nothings of mid-day waking life — of an enchanted life, which seems, now as i look back, the strife of some ill demon, with a power which left me in an evil hour, all that i felt, or saw, or thought, crowding, confused became (with thine unearthly beauty fraught) thou — and the nothing of a name. ix. the passionate spirit which hath known, and deeply felt the silent tone of its own self supremacy, — (i speak thus openly to thee, ’twere folly now to veil a thought with which this aching, breast is fraught) the soul which feels its innate right — the mystic empire and high power giv’n by the energetic might of genius, at its natal hour; which knows [believe me at this time, when falsehood were a ten-fold crime, there is a power in the high spirit to know the fate it will inherit] the soul, which knows such power, will still find pride the ruler of its will. yes! i was proud — and ye who know the magic of that meaning word, so oft perverted, will bestow your scorn, perhaps, when ye have heard that the proud spirit had been broken, the proud heart burst in agony at one upbraiding word or token of her that heart’s idolatry — i was ambitious — have ye known its fiery passion? — ye have not — a cottager, i mark’d a throne of half the world, as all my own, and murmur’d at such lowly lot! but it had pass’d me as a dream which, of light step, flies with the dew, that kindling thought — did not the beam of beauty, which did guide it through the livelong summer day, oppress my mind with double loveliness — * * * * * x. we walk’d together on the crown of a high mountain, which look’d down afar from its proud natural towers of rock and forest, on the hills — the dwindled hills, whence amid bowers her own fair hand had rear’d around, gush’d shoutingly a thousand rills, which as it were, in fairy bound embrac’d two hamlets — those our own — peacefully happy — yet alone — * * * * * i spoke to her of power and pride — but mystically, in such guise, that she might deem it naught beside the moment’s converse, in her eyes i read [perhaps too carelessly] a mingled feeling with my own; the flush on her bright cheek, to me, seem’d to become a queenly throne too well, that i should let it be a light in the dark wild, alone. xi. there — in that hour — a thought came o’er my mind, it had not known before — to leave her while we both were young, — to follow my high fate among the strife of nations, and redeem the idle words, which, as a dream now sounded to her heedless ear — i held no doubt — i knew no fear of peril in my wild career; to gain an empire, and throw down as nuptial dowry — a queen’s crown, the only feeling which possest, with her own image, my fond breast — who, that had known the secret thought of a young peasant’s bosom then, had deem’d him, in compassion, aught but one, whom phantasy had led astray from reason — among men ambition is chain’d down — nor fed [as in the desert, where the grand, the wild, the beautiful, conspire with their own breath to fan its fire] with thoughts such feeling can command; uncheck’d by sarcasm, and scorn of those, who hardly will conceive that any should become “great,” born in their own sphere — will not believe that they shall stoop in life to one whom daily they are wont to see familiarly — whom fortune’s sun hath ne’er shone dazzlingly upon lowly — and of their own degree — xii. i pictur’d to my fancy’s eye her silent, deep astonishment, when, a few fleeting years gone by, (for short the time my high hope lent to its most desperate intent,) she might recall in him, whom fame had gilded with a conquerer’s name, (with glory — such as might inspire perforce, a passing thought of one, whom she had deem’d in his own fire wither’d and blasted; who had gone a traitor, violate of the truth so plighted in his early youth,) her own alexis, who should plight the love he plighted then — again, and raise his infancy’s delight, the bride and queen of tamerlane — xiii. one noon of a bright summer’s day i pass’d from out the matted bow’r where in a deep, still slumber lay my ada. in that peaceful hour, a silent gaze was my farewell. i had no other solace — then t’awake her, and a falsehood tell of a feign’d journey, were again to trust the weakness of my heart to her soft thrilling voice: to part thus, haply, while in sleep she dream’d of long delight, nor yet had deem’d awake, that i had held a thought of parting, were with madness fraught; i knew not woman’s heart, alas! tho’ lov’d, and loving — let it pass. — xiv. i went from out the matted bow’r, and hurried madly on my way: and felt, with ev’ry flying hour, that bore me from my home, more gay; there is of earth an agony which, ideal, still may be the worst ill of mortality, ’tis bliss, in its own reality, too real, to his breast who lives not within himself but gives a portion of his willing soul to god, and to the great whole — to him, whose loving spirit will dwell with nature, in her wild paths; tell of her wond’rous ways, and telling bless her overpow’ring loveliness! a more than agony to him whose failing sight will grow dim with its own living gaze upon that loveliness around: the sun — the blue sky — the misty light of the pale cloud therein, whose hue is grace to its heav’nly bed of blue; dim! tho’ looking on all bright! o god! when the thoughts that may not pass will burst upon him, and alas! for the flight on earth to fancy giv’n, there are no words —— unless of heav’n xv. * * * * * look ’round thee now on samarcand, is she not queen of earth? her pride above all cities? in her hand their destinies? with all beside of glory, which the world hath known? stands she not proudly and alone? and who her sov’reign? timur he whom th’ astonish’d earth hath seen, with victory, on victory, redoubling age! and more, i ween, the zinghis’ yet re-echoing fame. and now what has he? what! a name. the sound of revelry by night comes o’er me, with the mingled voice of many with a breast as light, as if ’twere not the dying hour of one, in whom they did rejoice — as in a leader, haply — power its venom secretly imparts; nothing have i with human hearts. xvi. when fortune mark’d me for her own, and my proud hopes had reach’d a throne [it boots me not, good friar, to tell a tale the world but knows too well, how by what hidden deeds of might, i clamber’d to the tottering height,] i still was young; and well i ween my spirit what it e’er had been. my eyes were still on pomp and power, my wilder’d heart was far away, in vallies of the wild taglay, in mine own ada’s matted bow’r. i dwelt not long in samarcand ere, in a peasant’s lowly guise, i sought my long-abandon’d land, by sunset did its mountains rise in dusky grandeur to my eyes: but as i wander’d on the way my heart sunk with the sun’s ray. to him, who still would gaze upon the glory of the summer sun, there comes, when that sun will from him part, a sullen hopelessness of heart. that soul will hate the ev’ning mist so often lovely, and will list to the sound of the coming darkness [known to those whose spirits hark’n] as one who in a dream of night would fly but cannot from a danger nigh. what though the moon — the silvery moon shine on his path, in her high noon; her smile is chilly, and her beam in that time of dreariness will seem as the portrait of one after death; a likeness taken when the breath of young life, and the fire o’ the eye had lately been but had pass’d by. ’tis thus when the lovely summer sun of our boyhood, his course hath run: for all we live to know — is known; and all we seek to keep — hath flown; with the noon-day beauty, which is all. let life, then, as the day-flow’r, fall — the trancient, passionate day-flow’r, withering at the ev’ning hour. xvii. i reach’d my home — my home no more — for all was flown that made it so — i pass’d from out its mossy door, in vacant idleness of woe. there met me on its threshold stone a mountain hunter, i had known in childhood but he knew me not. something he spoke of the old cot: it had seen better days, he said; there rose a fountain once, and there full many a fair flow’r rais’d its head: but she who rear’d them was long dead, and in such follies had no part, what was there left me now? despair — a kingdom for a broken — heart.",1
"in youth’s spring, it was my lot to haunt of the wide earth a spot the which i could not love the less; so lovely was the loneliness of a wild lake, with black rock bound. and the tall pines that tower’d around. but when the night had thrown her pall upon that spot — as upon all, and the wind would pass me by in its stilly melody, my infant spirit would awake to the terror of the lone lake. yet that terror was not fright — but a tremulous delight, and a feeling undefin’d, springing from a darken’d mind. death was in that poison’d wave and in its gulf a fitting grave for him who thence could solace bring to his dark imagining; whose wild’ring thought could even make an eden of that dim lake.",1
"once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore— while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door. “’tis some visitor,” i muttered, “tapping at my chamber door— only this and nothing more.” ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december; and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor. eagerly i wished the morrow;—vainly i had sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost lenore— for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore— nameless here for evermore. and the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before; so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating “’tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door— some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;— this it is and nothing more.” presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer, “sir,” said i, “or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore; but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping, and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door, that i scarce was sure i heard you”—here i opened wide the door;— darkness there and nothing more. deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering, fearing, doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before; but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token, and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “lenore?” this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “lenore!”— merely this and nothing more. back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning, soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before. “surely,” said i, “surely that is something at my window lattice; let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore— let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;— ’tis the wind and nothing more!” open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter, in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore; not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he; but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door— perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door— perched, and sat, and nothing more. then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore, “though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” i said, “art sure no craven, ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore— tell me what thy lordly name is on the night’s plutonian shore!” quoth the raven “nevermore.” much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly, though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore; for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door— bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door, with such name as “nevermore.” but the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour. nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered— till i scarcely more than muttered “other friends have flown before— on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.” then the bird said “nevermore.” startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, “doubtless,” said i, “what it utters is its only stock and store caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore— till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore of ‘never—nevermore’.” but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door; then, upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore— what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore meant in croaking “nevermore.” this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core; this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining on the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er, but whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er, she shall press, ah, nevermore! then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor. “wretch,” i cried, “thy god hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of lenore; quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!” quoth the raven “nevermore.” “prophet!” said i, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!— whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore, desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted— on this home by horror haunted—tell me truly, i implore— is there—is there balm in gilead?—tell me—tell me, i implore!” quoth the raven “nevermore.” “prophet!” said i, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil! by that heaven that bends above us—by that god we both adore— tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn, it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore— clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore.” quoth the raven “nevermore.” “be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” i shrieked, upstarting— “get thee back into the tempest and the night’s plutonian shore! leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken! leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door! take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!” quoth the raven “nevermore.” and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door; and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming, and the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted—nevermore!",1
"far away — far away — far away — as far at least lies that valley as the day down within the golden east — all things lovely — are not they far away — far away? it is called the valley nis. and a syriac tale there is thereabout which time hath said shall not be interpreted. something about satan’s dart — something about angel wings — much about a broken heart — all about unhappy things: but “the valley nis” at best means “the valley of unrest.” once it smil’d a silent dell where the people did not dwell, having gone unto the wars — and the sly, mysterious stars, with a visage full of meaning, o’er the unguarded flowers were leaning: or the sun ray dripp’d all red thro’ the tulips overhead, then grew paler as it fell on the quiet asphodel. now the unhappy shall confess nothing there is motionless: helen, like thy human eye there th’ uneasy violets lie — there the reedy grass doth wave over the old forgotten grave — one by one from the tree top there the eternal dews do drop — there the vague and dreamy trees do roll like seas in northern breeze around the stormy hebrides — there the gorgeous clouds do fly, rustling everlastingly, through the terror-stricken sky, rolling like a waterfall o’er th’ horizon’s fiery wall — there the moon doth shine by night with a most unsteady light — there the sun doth reel by day “over the hills and far away.”",1

"i saw thee once — once only — years ago: i must not say how many — but not many. it was a july midnight; and from out a full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring, sought a precipitant pathway up through heaven, there fell a silvery-silken veil of light, with quietude, and sultriness, and slumber, upon the upturn’d faces of a thousand roses that grew in an enchanted garden, where no wind dared to stir, unless on tip-toe — fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses that gave out, in return for the love-light, their odorous souls in an ecstatic death — fell on the upturn’d faces of these roses that smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted by thee and by the poetry of thy presence. clad all in white, upon a violet bank i saw thee half reclining; while the moon fell on the upturn’d faces of the roses, and on thine own, upturn’d — alas! in sorrow! was it not fate that, on this july midnight — was it not fate (whose name is also sorrow) that bade me pause before that garden-gate to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses? no footstep stirred: the hated world all slept, save only thee and me. i paused — i looked — and in an instant all things disappeared. (ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!) the pearly lustre of the moon went out: the mossy banks and the meandering paths, the happy flowers and the repining trees, were seen no more: the very roses’ odors died in the arms of the adoring airs. all — all expired save thee — save less than thou: save only the divine light in thine eyes — save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes. i saw but them — they were the world to me. i saw but them — saw only them for hours — saw only them until the moon went down. what wild heart-histories seemed to lie enwritten upon those crystalline, celestial spheres! how dark a wo! yet how sublime a hope! how silently serene a sea of pride! how daring an ambition! yet how deep — how fathomless a capacity for love! but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight, into a western couch of thunder-cloud, and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees didst glide away. only thine eyes remained. they would not go — they never yet have gone. lighting my lonely pathway home that night, they have not left me (as my hopes have) since. they follow me — they lead me through the years. they are my ministers — yet i their slave. their office is to illumine and enkindle — my duty to be saved by their bright light and purified in their electric fire — and sanctified in their elysian fire. they fill my soul with beauty (which is hope,) and are far up in heaven, the stars i kneel to in the sad, silent watches of my night; while even in the meridian glare of day i see them still — two sweetly scintillant venuses, unextinguished by the sun!",1

"the skies they were ashen and sober; the leaves they were crispéd and sere — the leaves they were withering and sere: it was night, in the lonesome october of my most immemorial year: it was hard by the dim lake of auber, in the misty mid region of weir: — it was down by the dank tarn of auber, in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir. here once, through an alley titanic, of cypress, i roamed with my soul — of cypress, with psyche, my soul. these were days when my heart was volcanic as the scoriac rivers that roll — as the lavas that restlessly roll their sulphurous currents down yaanek, in the ultimate climes of the pole — that groan as they roll down mount yaanek in the realms of the boreal pole. our talk had been serious and sober, but our thoughts they were palsied and sere — our memories were treacherous and sere; for we knew not the month was october, and we marked not the night of the year — (ah, night of all nights in the year!) we noted not the dim lake of auber, (though once we had journeyed down here) we remembered not the dank tarn of auber, nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir. and now, as the night was senescent, and star-dials pointed to morn — as the star-dials hinted of morn — at the end of our path a liquescent and nebulous lustre was born out of which a miraculous crescent arose with a duplicate horn — astarte’s bediamonded crescent, distinct with its duplicate horn. and i said — “she is warmer than dian; she rolls through an ether of sighs — she revels in a region of sighs. she has seen that the tears are not dry on these cheeks where the worm never dies, and has come past the stars of the lion, to point us the path to the skies — to the lethean peace of the skies — come up, in despite of the lion, to shine on us with her bright eyes — come up, through the lair of the lion, with love in her luminous eyes.” but psyche, uplifting her finger, said — “sadly this star i mistrust — her pallor i strangely mistrust — ah, hasten! — ah, let us not linger! ah, fly! — let us fly! — for we must.” in terror she spoke; letting sink her wings till they trailed in the dust — in agony sobbed; letting sink her plumes till they trailed in the dust — till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust. i replied — “this is nothing but dreaming. let us on, by this tremulous light! let us bathe in this crystalline light! its sybillic splendor is beaming with hope and in beauty to-night — see! — it flickers up the sky through the night! ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming and be sure it will lead us aright — we safely may trust to a gleaming that cannot but guide us aright since it flickers up to heaven through the night.” thus i pacified psyche and kissed her, and tempted her out of her gloom — and conquered her scruples and gloom; and we passed to the end of the vista — but were stopped by the door of a tomb — by the door of a legended tomb: — and i said — “what is written, sweet sister, on the door of this legended tomb?” she replied — “ulalume — ulalume! — ’t is the vault of thy lost ulalume!” then my heart it grew ashen and sober as the leaves that were crispéd and sere — as the leaves that were withering and sere — and i cried — “it was surely october, on this very night of last year, that i journeyed — i journeyed down here! — that i brought a dread burden down here — on this night, of all nights in the year, ah, what demon hath tempted me here? well i know, now, this dim lake of auber — this misty mid region of weir: — well i know, now, this dank tarn of auber — this ghoul-haunted woodland of weir.” said we, then, — the two, then, — “ah, can it have been that the woodlandish ghouls — the pitiful, the merciful ghouls, to bar up our way and to ban it from the secret that lies in these wolds — from the thing that lies hidden in these wolds — have drawn up the spectre of a planet from the limbo of lunary souls — this sinfully scintillant planet from the hell of planetary souls?”",1

"as a decrepit father takes delight to see his active child do deeds of youth, so i, made lame by fortune's dearest spite, take all my comfort of thy worth and truth. for whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit, or any of these all, or all, or more, entitled in thy parts do crowned sit, i make my love engrafted to this store: so then i am not lame, poor, nor despised, whilst that this shadow doth such substance give that i in thy abundance am sufficed and by a part of all thy glory live. look, what is best, that best i wish in thee: this wish i have; then ten times happy me!",0
"how can my muse want subject to invent, while thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse thine own sweet argument, too excellent for every vulgar paper to rehearse? o, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me worthy perusal stand against thy sight; for who's so dumb that cannot write to thee, when thou thyself dost give invention light? be thou the tenth muse, ten times more in worth than those old nine which rhymers invocate; and he that calls on thee, let him bring forth eternal numbers to outlive long date. if my slight muse do please these curious days, the pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.",0
"o, how thy worth with manners may i sing, when thou art all the better part of me? what can mine own praise to mine own self bring? and what is 't but mine own when i praise thee? even for this let us divided live, and our dear love lose name of single one, that by this separation i may give that due to thee which thou deservest alone. o absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove, were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave to entertain the time with thoughts of love, which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive, and that thou teachest how to make one twain, by praising him here who doth hence remain!",0
"unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend upon thyself thy beauty's legacy? nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend, and being frank she lends to those are free. then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse the bounteous largess given thee to give? profitless usurer, why dost thou use so great a sum of sums, yet canst not live? for having traffic with thyself alone, thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive. then how, when nature calls thee to be gone, what acceptable audit canst thou leave? thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee, which, used, lives th' executor to be.",0
"take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all; what hast thou then more than thou hadst before? no love, my love, that thou mayst true love call; all mine was thine before thou hadst this more. then if for my love thou my love receivest, i cannot blame thee for my love thou usest; but yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest by wilful taste of what thyself refusest. i do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief, although thou steal thee all my poverty; and yet, love knows, it is a greater grief to bear love's wrong than hate's known injury. lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows, kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.",0
"those petty wrongs that liberty commits, when i am sometime absent from thy heart, thy beauty and thy years full well befits, for still temptation follows where thou art. gentle thou art and therefore to be won, beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed; and when a woman woos, what woman's son will sourly leave her till she have prevailed? ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear, and chide try beauty and thy straying youth, who lead thee in their riot even there where thou art forced to break a twofold truth, hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee, thine, by thy beauty being false to me.",0
"that thou hast her, it is not all my grief, and yet it may be said i loved her dearly; that she hath thee, is of my wailing chief, a loss in love that touches me more nearly. loving offenders, thus i will excuse ye: thou dost love her, because thou knowst i love her; and for my sake even so doth she abuse me, suffering my friend for my sake to approve her. if i lose thee, my loss is my love's gain, and losing her, my friend hath found that loss; both find each other, and i lose both twain, and both for my sake lay on me this cross: but here's the joy; my friend and i are one; sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.",0
"when most i wink, then do mine eyes best see, for all the day they view things unrespected; but when i sleep, in dreams they look on thee, and darkly bright are bright in dark directed. then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright, how would thy shadow's form form happy show to the clear day with thy much clearer light, when to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so! how would, i say, mine eyes be blessed made by looking on thee in the living day, when in dead night thy fair imperfect shade through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay! all days are nights to see till i see thee, and nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.",0
"if the dull substance of my flesh were thought, injurious distance should not stop my way; for then despite of space i would be brought, from limits far remote where thou dost stay. no matter then although my foot did stand upon the farthest earth removed from thee; for nimble thought can jump both sea and land as soon as think the place where he would be. but ah! thought kills me that i am not thought, to leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone, but that so much of earth and water wrought i must attend time's leisure with my moan, receiving nought by elements so slow but heavy tears, badges of either's woe.",0
"the other two, slight air and purging fire, are both with thee, wherever i abide; the first my thought, the other my desire, these present-absent with swift motion slide. for when these quicker elements are gone in tender embassy of love to thee, my life, being made of four, with two alone sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy; until life's composition be recured by those swift messengers return'd from thee, who even but now come back again, assured of thy fair health, recounting it to me: this told, i joy; but then no longer glad, i send them back again and straight grow sad.",0
"mine eye and heart are at a mortal war how to divide the conquest of thy sight; mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar, my heart mine eye the freedom of that right. my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie-- a closet never pierced with crystal eyes-- but the defendant doth that plea deny and says in him thy fair appearance lies. to 'cide this title is impanneled a quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart, and by their verdict is determined the clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part: as thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part, and my heart's right thy inward love of heart.",0
"betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took, and each doth good turns now unto the other: when that mine eye is famish'd for a look, or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother, with my love's picture then my eye doth feast and to the painted banquet bids my heart; another time mine eye is my heart's guest and in his thoughts of love doth share a part: so, either by thy picture or my love, thyself away art resent still with me; for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move, and i am still with them and they with thee; or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.",0
"how careful was i, when i took my way, each trifle under truest bars to thrust, that to my use it might unused stay from hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust! but thou, to whom my jewels trifles are, most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief, thou, best of dearest and mine only care, art left the prey of every vulgar thief. thee have i not lock'd up in any chest, save where thou art not, though i feel thou art, within the gentle closure of my breast, from whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part; and even thence thou wilt be stol'n, i fear, for truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.",0
"against that time, if ever that time come, when i shall see thee frown on my defects, when as thy love hath cast his utmost sum, call'd to that audit by advised respects; against that time when thou shalt strangely pass and scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye, when love, converted from the thing it was, shall reasons find of settled gravity,-- against that time do i ensconce me here within the knowledge of mine own desert, and this my hand against myself uprear, to guard the lawful reasons on thy part: to leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws, since why to love i can allege no cause.",0
"those hours, that with gentle work did frame the lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell, will play the tyrants to the very same and that unfair which fairly doth excel: for never-resting time leads summer on to hideous winter and confounds him there; sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone, beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where: then, were not summer's distillation left, a liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass, beauty's effect with beauty were bereft, nor it nor no remembrance what it was: but flowers distill'd though they with winter meet, leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.",0
"how heavy do i journey on the way, when what i seek, my weary travel's end, doth teach that ease and that repose to say 'thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!' the beast that bears me, tired with my woe, plods dully on, to bear that weight in me, as if by some instinct the wretch did know his rider loved not speed, being made from thee: the bloody spur cannot provoke him on that sometimes anger thrusts into his hide; which heavily he answers with a groan, more sharp to me than spurring to his side; for that same groan doth put this in my mind; my grief lies onward and my joy behind.",0
"then let not winter's ragged hand deface in thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd: make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place with beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd. that use is not forbidden usury, which happies those that pay the willing loan; that's for thyself to breed another thee, or ten times happier, be it ten for one; ten times thyself were happier than thou art, if ten of thine ten times refigured thee: then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart, leaving thee living in posterity? be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair to be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.",0
"lo! in the orient when the gracious light lifts up his burning head, each under eye doth homage to his new-appearing sight, serving with looks his sacred majesty; and having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill, resembling strong youth in his middle age, yet mortal looks adore his beauty still, attending on his golden pilgrimage; but when from highmost pitch, with weary car, like feeble age, he reeleth from the day, the eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are from his low tract and look another way: so thou, thyself out-going in thy noon, unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.",0
"music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly? sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy. why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly, or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy? if the true concord of well-tuned sounds, by unions married, do offend thine ear, they do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear. mark how one string, sweet husband to another, strikes each in each by mutual ordering, resembling sire and child and happy mother who all in one, one pleasing note do sing: whose speechless song, being many, seeming one, sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'",0
"is it for fear to wet a widow's eye that thou consumest thyself in single life? ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die. the world will wail thee, like a makeless wife; the world will be thy widow and still weep that thou no form of thee hast left behind, when every private widow well may keep by children's eyes her husband's shape in mind. look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it; but beauty's waste hath in the world an end, and kept unused, the user so destroys it. no love toward others in that bosom sits that on himself such murderous shame commits.",0
